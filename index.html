<p> Beer, even craft beer, will go ‘bad’ under normal conditions. In fact, the quality of beer starts to change as soon as it leaves the brewery. Does bread straight out of the oven taste as good after sitting on a counter for a week? An average keg of beer has a shelf life of a few to several months, if kept in an optimal environment, which include being stored cold.

Considering that up to a third of that time is spent sitting at the brewery or in a distributor’s warehouse, the window is even smaller for the consumer to enjoy it. Brewers, distributors and retailers work together to make sure that consumers receive beer that is as close to how the brewer intended as possible. Even so, poor storage practices or poor draught system maintenance can quickly degrade draught beer quality. With this in mind, how do you recognize a beer that is past its prime and when should you send back the craft beer you ordered?
